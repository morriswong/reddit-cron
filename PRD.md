Here's a comprehensive PRD (Product Requirements Document) for your Reddit data collection system:

# PRD: Reddit Subreddit Data Collection Pipeline

## Overview
Create an automated system that periodically downloads Reddit subreddit data via JSON API and stores it in a GitHub repository using GitHub Actions cron jobs.

## Objectives
- Automate collection of Reddit subreddit data
- Maintain historical archive of subreddit posts
- Ensure reliable, scheduled execution
- Organize data with clear naming conventions

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
The system shall download JSON data from Reddit's API endpoint `https://www.reddit.com/r/{subreddit}.json` and save it to the repository with structured naming.

### File Naming Convention
Files shall be named using the format: `{subreddit}_{YYYY-MM-DD}.json`
- Example: `macapps_2025-01-15.json`
- Use ISO 8601 date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Ensure consistent lowercase naming

### Directory Structure
```
data/
├── macapps/
│   ├── macapps_2025-01-15.json
│   ├── macapps_2025-01-16.json
│   └── ...
└── [other-subreddits]/
    └── ...
```

### Scheduling
- Execute daily at a consistent time (e.g., 12:00 UTC)
- Use GitHub Actions cron syntax: `0 12 * * *`
- Consider rate limiting and Reddit API guidelines

## Implementation Specifications

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- Trigger: Scheduled cron job
- Runner: `ubuntu-latest`
- Required steps:
  1. Checkout repository
  2. Download Reddit JSON data
  3. Save with proper naming convention
  4. Commit and push changes

### Error Handling
- Handle network failures gracefully
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Log errors for debugging
- Continue execution if one subreddit fails (for multi-subreddit setups)

### Data Validation
- Verify JSON structure before saving
- Check for empty or malformed responses
- Validate file size is reasonable

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: For repository write access
- Optional: `REDDIT_USER_AGENT`: Custom user agent string

### Repository Settings
- Enable GitHub Actions
- Configure appropriate branch protection if needed
- Set up notifications for workflow failures

## Extensibility Considerations

### Multi-Subreddit Support
Design to easily extend for multiple subreddits:
```yaml
subreddits:
  - macapps
  - iosapps
  - androidapps
```

### Configurable Parameters
- Schedule flexibility
- File naming patterns
- Data retention policies
- Compression options

## Success Criteria
- Files are downloaded and saved daily without manual intervention
- Naming convention is consistently applied
- No data loss or corruption
- Workflow runs reliably with minimal failures
- Historical data is preserved and easily accessible

## Risk Mitigation
- Reddit API rate limiting compliance
- Repository size management (consider data retention policies)
- Backup strategy for critical data
- Monitoring and alerting for workflow failures

## Future Enhancements
- Data deduplication
- Compressed storage options
- Data analysis capabilities
- Web interface for browsing historical data
- Integration with data processing pipelines

This PRD provides a solid foundation for implementing your Reddit data collection system with GitHub Actions while ensuring scalability and maintainability.
